                        Much blood has been wasted in the streets of Lebanon throughout its history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, blood banks are almost empty and families of patients in need of
                        blood struggle to find potential donors every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to improve the anonymous and voluntary blood donation
                        system in Lebanon â€” for that, we created a movement.
